# MOBILE-FORENSICS

Mobile forensics Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are designed to test participants' skills and knowledge in extracting and analyzing data from mobile devices. These challenges usually involve investigating various aspects of mobile forensics, such as recovering deleted data, analyzing app artifacts, deciphering encrypted data, and identifying potential security vulnerabilities.

# Tools

# 1. ![Jadx-gui](https://github.com/wlcaption/jadx_gui.git)
   
    Dex to Java decompiler including Command line and GUI tools for produce Java source code from Android Dex and Apk files

# 2. ![SQLite](https://github.com/dutchcoders/forensics-sqlite.git)

   Dumps frames of the -wal (write ahead log) file of sqlite databases. The write ahead log is being written every once in a while to the real database. Using the write ahead log it will be possible to do forensics analyses on the history of the database (eg. modified records, added records etc.

   SQLite databases are often used mobile applications.
# 3. ![OpenMF](https://github.com/scorelab/OpenMF.git)

The OpenMF project, an open-source forensic tool that supports digital forensic investigators across the entire digital forensic investigation process.

- **Data Extraction**: OpenMF simplifies the extraction of relevant data from Android smartphones.

- **Case Management**: Manage individual cases efficiently, keeping everything organized.

- **Analysis Reports**: Generate in-depth analysis reports for each case, providing meaningful insights.

## Why OpenMF?

OpenMF is an essential tool for digital forensic organizations, streamlining the investigation process and enhancing efficiency. While it currently operates as a command-line tool, we have exciting plans for the future.
